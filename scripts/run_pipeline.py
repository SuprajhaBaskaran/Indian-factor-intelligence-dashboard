    The RSS feeds are live, so two runs minutes apart can see a different set of
    articles for the current week. That difference propagates: it moves the
    current month's `news_sentiment`, which moves `news_stress_score` and
    `transition_risk`, which moves the regime row, the allocation and the
    rebalance trades. Measured across two runs, it perturbed one month out of
    153 and changed no regime label -- but "it barely matters today" is not the
    same as "it is reproducible", and a backtest nobody else can re-run to the
    same number cannot be checked.

    Freshness wins by default, because this pipeline runs on a daily schedule
    and a dashboard showing yesterday's sentiment is worse than one that cannot
    be byte-reproduced. Reproducibility is bought back differently: **every**
    fetch is written to `data_input/news_snapshot.json` with a SHA-256 of the
    article set, that hash is folded into the experiment manifest's fingerprint,
    and `NEWS_REPLAY=1` re-runs the pipeline from the snapshot to reproduce a
    past run exactly.

    So a run is not silently reproducible and it is not silently unreproducible
    either -- it carries the evidence of which it was.

    Must be called exactly once per run. Two calls meant two network fetches,
    and the second overwrote the snapshot with an article set the regime model
    had never seen -- so the snapshot did not record what the run actually used.
