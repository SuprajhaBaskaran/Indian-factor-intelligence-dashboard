"""Guard tests for defects that reached the dashboard and stayed there.

Each test here corresponds to a fault that was present in a shipped
`public/data/*.json` and survived a full pipeline rewrite, because nothing
checked for it. They are deliberately narrow and dependency-free: they read
the published artifacts rather than re-running the pipeline, so they are fast
and they test what a consumer of the dashboard would actually receive.
